In greater detail, 
Small: 0 - 20 (%) of polygon, sporadically distributed
Medium: 20 - 50 (%), some contiguous patches
Large: more than 50 (%), extensive patches, widespread
NA: not of interest*

* e.g. We are not interested in estimating how much forest (small/medium/large) is within a polygon.

These criteria were set to get a general estimation of how much a specific land cover type (i.e. plantations) existed within a sampled polygon in the visual assessment. Polygons were created from homogeneous contiguous pixels belonging to one of three land cover change transitions (forest into cropland, mosaic vegetation and shrubland).
